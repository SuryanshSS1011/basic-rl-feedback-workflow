Ksenia can't remove or add letters in any of the words.\n\nWhat is the minimal number of seconds Ksenia is required to spend to change the last year list to the current one?\n\nThe lists are unordered. That means, two lists are considered equal if and only if the number of occurrences of any string is the same in both lists.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of T-shirts.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains $a_i$ \u2014 the size of the $i$-th T-shirt of the list for the previous year.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains $b_i$ \u2014 the size of the $i$-th T-shirt of the list for the current year.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all the sizes in the input are valid. It is also guaranteed that Ksenia can produce list $b$ from the list $a$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimal number of seconds Ksenia is required to spend to change the last year list to the current one.

The description of each testcase follows.\n- The first line of every testcase contains a single integer, $n$, which is the number of integers in the original sequence.\n- The second line contains $n$ integers: $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$, which forms the original sequence.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each testcase output a single line containing one integer, which should be the length of the longest UpDown subsegment that you can get after inserting at most one integer.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 2$\n- $1 \\le n \\le 10^6$\n- $1 \\le s_i \\le 10^9$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (20 points): $1 \\le n \\le 100$\nSubtask #2 (10 points): $1 \\le n \\le 10000$\nSubtask #3 (70 points): Original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2\n7\n100 1 10 3 20 25 24\n5\n3 3 2 4 1\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n7\n6\n\n-----Explanation-----\nTestcase 1: The original sequence is (100, 1, 10, 3, 20, 25, 24). Suppose you insert the element 5 between the elements 20 and 25, you will get the new sequence (100, 1, 10, 3, 20, 5, 25, 24). The longest UpDown subsegment of this sequence is (1, 10, 3, 20, 5, 25, 24), whose length is 7. You can check that you cannot do any better, and hence the answer is 7.\nTestcase 2: The original sequence is (3, 3, 2, 4, 1). Suppose you insert the element 4 at the end, you will get the new sequence (3, 3, 2, 4, 1, 4). This entire sequence is UpDown, and so the longest UpDown subsegment of this sequence is (3, 3, 2, 4, 1, 4), whose length is 6. You can check that you cannot do any better, and hence the answer is 6.\n    \"\"\"\n\n# Write a Python program to solve this:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# Solution:\n\n# S", "model": "deepseek", "dataset": "apps_plus", "reward": 0.4, "rfunc": 0.0, "rsec": 1.0, "compiles": true, "tests_passed": 0, "tests_total": 1, "has_security_issues": false}

{"prompt_id": "apps_plus_2070", "prompt": "\ndef lgfzW():\n    \"\"\"Instructors of Some Informatics School make students go to bed.\n\nThe house contains n rooms, in each room exactly b students were supposed to sleep. However, at the time of curfew it happened that many students are not located in their assigned rooms. The rooms are arranged in a row and numbered from 1 to n. Initially, in i-th room there are a_{i} students. All students are currently somewhere in the house, therefore a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{n} = nb. Also 2 instructors live in this house.\n\nThe process of curfew enforcement is the following. One instructor starts near room 1 and moves toward room n, while the second instructor starts near room n and moves toward room 1. After processing current room, each instructor moves on to the next one. Both instructors enter rooms and move simultaneously, if n is odd, then only the first instructor processes the middle room. When all rooms are processed, the process ends.\n\nWhen an instructor processes a room, she counts the number of students in the room, then turns off the light, and locks the room. Also, if the number of students inside the processed room is not equal to b, the instructor writes down the number of this room into her notebook (and turns off the light, and locks the room). Instructors are in a hurry (to prepare the study plan for the next day), so they don't care about who is in the room, but only about the number of students.\n\nWhile instructors are inside the rooms, students can run between rooms that are not locked and not being processed. A student can run by at most d rooms, that is she can move to a room with number that differs my at most d. Also, after (or instead of) running each student can hide under a bed in a room she is in. In this case the instructor will not count her during the processing. In each room any number of students can hide simultaneously.\n\nFormally, here is what's happening:  A curfew is announced, at this point in room i there are a_{i} students.  Each student can run to another room but not further than d rooms away from her initial room, or stay in place. After that each student can optionally hide under a bed.  Instructors enter room 1 and room n, they count students there and lock the room (after it no one can enter or leave this room).  Each student from rooms with numbers from 2 to n - 1 can run to another room but not further than d rooms away from her current room, or stay in place. Each student can optionally hide under a bed.  Instructors move from room 1 to room 2 and from room n to room n - 1.

This way, the first instructor writes down room 2, and the second writes down nothing.\n\nIn the second sample one of the optimal strategies is the following: firstly all students in room 1 hide, all students from room 2 run to room 3. On the next stage one student runs from room 3 to room 4, and 5 students hide. This way, the first instructor writes down rooms 1 and 2, the second instructor writes down rooms 5 and 6.\n    \"\"\"\n", "completion": "# Task: \ndef lgfzW():\n    \"\"\"Instructors of Some Informatics School make students go to bed.\n\nThe house contains n rooms, in each room exactly b students were supposed to sleep. However, at the time of curfew it happened that many students are not located in their assigned rooms. The rooms are arranged in a row and numbered from 1 to n. Initially, in i-th room there are a_{i} students. All students are currently somewhere in the house, therefore a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{n} = nb. Also 2 instructors live in this house.\n\nThe process of curfew enforcement is the following. One instructor starts near room 1 and moves toward room n, while the second instructor starts near room n and moves toward room 1. After processing current room, each instructor moves on to the next one. Both instructors enter rooms and move simultaneously, if n is odd, then only the first instructor processes the middle room. When all rooms are processed, the process ends.\n\nWhen an instructor processes a room, she counts the number of students in the room, then turns off the light, and locks the room. Also, if the number of students inside the processed room is not equal to b, the instructor writes down the number of this room into her notebook (and turns off the light, and locks the room). Instructors are in a hurry (to prepare the study plan for the next day), so they don't care about who is in the room, but only about the number of students.\n\nWhile instructors are inside the rooms, students can run between rooms that are not locked and not being processed. A student can run by at most d rooms, that is she can move to a room with number that differs my at most d. Also, after (or instead of) running each student can hide under a bed in a room she is in. In this case the instructor will not count her during the processing. In each room any number of students can hide simultaneously.\n\nFormally, here is what's happening:  A curfew is announced, at this point in room i there are a_{i} students.  Each student can run to another room but not further than d rooms away from her initial room, or stay in place. After that each student can optionally hide under a bed.  Instructors enter room 1 and room n, they count students there and lock the room (after it no one can enter or leave this room).  Each student from rooms with numbers from 2 to n - 1 can run to another room but not further than d rooms away from her current room, or stay in place. Each student can optionally hide under a bed.  Instructors move from room 1 to room 2 and from room n to room n - 1.  This process continues until all rooms are processed. \n\nLet x_1 denote the number of rooms in which the first instructor counted the number of non-hidden students different from b, and x_2 be the same number for the second instructor.

Then we do the following: while there is at least one not marked element in $p$, we find the leftmost such element, list all elements that are reachable from it in the order they appear in $p$, mark all of these elements, then cyclically shift the list of those elements so that the maximum appears at the first position, and add this list as an element of $l$. After all elements are marked, $l$ is the result of this decomposition.\n\nFor example, if we want to build a decomposition of $p = [5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 8, 6]$, we do the following:  initially $p = [5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 8, 6]$ (bold elements are marked), $l = []$;  the leftmost unmarked element is $5$; $5$ and $1$ are reachable from it, so the list we want to shift is $[5, 1]$; there is no need to shift it, since maximum is already the first element;  $p = [\\textbf{5}, 4, 2, 3, \\textbf{1}, 7, 8, 6]$, $l = [[5, 1]]$;  the leftmost unmarked element is $4$, the list of reachable elements is $[4, 2, 3]$; the maximum is already the first element, so there's no need to shift it;  $p = [\\textbf{5}, \\textbf{4}, \\textbf{2}, \\textbf{3}, \\textbf{1}, 7, 8, 6]$, $l = [[5, 1], [4, 2, 3]]$;  the leftmost unmarked element is $7$, the list of reachable elements is $[7, 8, 6]$; we have to shift it, so it becomes $[8, 6, 7]$;  $p = [\\textbf{5}, \\textbf{4}, \\textbf{2}, \\textbf{3}, \\textbf{1}, \\textbf{7}, \\textbf{8}, \\textbf{6}]$, $l = [[5, 1], [4, 2, 3], [8, 6, 7]]$;  all elements are marked, so $[[5, 1], [4, 2, 3], [8, 6, 7]]$ is the result. \n\nThe New Year transformation of a permutation is defined as follows: we build the decomposition of this permutation; then we sort all lists in decomposition in ascending order of the first elements (we don't swap the elements in these lists, only the lists themselves); then we concatenate the lists into one list which becomes a new permutation. For example, the New Year transformation of $p = [5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 8, 6]$ is built as follows:  the decomposition is $[[5, 1], [4, 2, 3], [8, 6, 7]]$;  after sorting the decomposition, it becomes $[[4, 2, 3], [5, 1], [8, 6, 7]]$;  $[4, 2, 3, 5, 1, 8, 6, 7]$ is the result of the transformation. \n\nWe call a permutation good if the result of its transformation is the same as the permutation itself. For example, $[4, 3, 1, 2, 8, 5, 6, 7]$ is a good permutation; and $[5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 8, 6]$ is bad, since the result of transformation is $[4, 2, 3, 5, 1, 8, 6, 7]$.\n\nYour task is the following: given $n$ and $k$, find the $k$-th (lexicographically) good permutation of length $n$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThen the test cases follow.

Since Chef is a busy person, he needs your help to support his friend Alex.  \nAlex's theatre has four showtimes: 12 PM, 3 PM, 6 PM and 9 PM. He has four movies which he would like to play \u2015 let's call them A, B, C and D. Each of these movies must be played exactly once and all four must be played at different showtimes. For each showtime, the price of a ticket must be one of the following: Rs 25, Rs 50, Rs 75 or Rs 100. The prices of tickets for different showtimes must also be different.\nThrough his app, Alex receives various requests from his customers. Each request has the form \"I want to watch this movie at this showtime\". Let's assume that the number of people who come to watch a movie at a given showtime is the same as the number of requests for that movie at that showtime.\nIt is not necessary to accommodate everyone's requests \u2015 Alex just wants to earn the maximum amount of money. There is no restriction on the capacity of the theatre. However, for each movie that is not watched by anyone, Alex would suffer a loss of Rs 100 (deducted from the profit).\nYou are given $N$ requests Alex received during one day.

Due to the increasing number of platforms for watching movies online, his business is not running well. As a friend, Alex asked Chef to help him maximise his profits. Since Chef is a busy person, he needs your help to support his friend Alex.  \nAlex's theatre has four showtimes: 12 PM, 3 PM, 6 PM and 9 PM. He has four movies which he would like to play \u2015 let's call them A, B, C and D. Each of these movies must be played exactly once and all four must be played at different showtimes. For each showtime, the price of a ticket must be one of the following: Rs 25, Rs 50, Rs 75 or Rs 100. The prices of tickets for different showtimes must also be different.\nThrough his app, Alex receives various requests from his customers. Each request has the form \"I want to watch this movie at this showtime\". Let's assume that the number of people who come to watch a movie at a given showtime is the same as the number of requests for that movie at that showtime.\nIt is not necessary to accommodate everyone's requests \u2015 Alex just wants to earn the maximum amount of money. There is no restriction on the capacity of the theatre. However, for each movie that is not watched by anyone, Alex would suffer a loss of Rs 100 (deducted from the profit).\nYou are given $N$ requests Alex received during one day. Find the maximum amount of money he can earn on that day by choosing when to play which movies and with which prices. \n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

There are two options for pavement tiles:  $1 \\times 1$ tiles\u00a0\u2014 each tile costs $x$ burles and covers exactly $1$ square;  $1 \\times 2$ tiles\u00a0\u2014 each tile costs $y$ burles and covers exactly $2$ adjacent squares of the same row. Note that you are not allowed to rotate these tiles or cut them into $1 \\times 1$ tiles. \n\nYou should cover all the white squares, no two tiles should overlap and no black squares should be covered by tiles.\n\nWhat is the smallest total price of the tiles needed to cover all the white squares?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 500$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of testcases. Then the description of $t$ testcases follow.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains four integers $n$, $m$, $x$ and $y$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$; $1 \\le m \\le 1000$; $1 \\le x, y \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the Theatre square, the price of the $1 \\times 1$ tile and the price of the $1 \\times 2$ tile.\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains $m$ characters. The $j$-th character in the $i$-th line is $a_{i,j}$. If $a_{i,j} = $ \"*\", then the $j$-th square in the $i$-th row should be black, and if $a_{i,j} = $ \".\", then the $j$-th square in the $i$-th row should be white.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of $n \\times m$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each testcase print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the smallest total price of the tiles needed to cover all the white squares in burles.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n1 1 10 1\n.\n1 2 10 1\n..\n2 1 10 1\n.\n.\n3 3 3 7\n..*\n*..\n.*.\n\nOutput\n10\n1\n20\n18\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first testcase you are required to use a single $1 \\times 1$ tile, even though $1 \\times 2$ tile is cheaper. So the total price is $10$ burles.\n\nIn the second testcase you can either use two $1 \\times 1$ tiles and spend $20$ burles or use a single $1 \\times 2$ tile and spend $1$ burle. The second option is cheaper, thus the answer is $1$.\n\nThe third testcase shows that you can't rotate $1 \\times 2$ tiles. You still have to use two $1 \\times 1$ tiles for the total price of $20$.\n\nIn the fourth testcase the cheapest way is to use $1 \\times 1$ tiles everywhere. The total cost is $6 \\cdot 3 = 18$.\n    \"\"\"\n\n# Write a Python program to solve this:\n\ndef yjowB():\n    pass\n\n# ------------------- END OF PROBLEM -------------------", "model": "deepseek", "dataset": "apps_plus", "reward": 0.4, "rfunc": 0.0, "rsec": 1.0, "compiles": true, "tests_passed": 0, "tests_total": 3, "has_security_issues": false}

{"prompt_id": "apps_plus_7053", "prompt": "\ndef pdswf():\n    \"\"\"In the world of DragonBool there are fierce warriors called Soints. Also there are even fiercer warriors called Sofloats \u2013 the mortal enemies of Soints.\n\nThe power of each warrior is determined by the amount of chakra he possesses which is some positive integer. Warriors with zero level of chakra are dead warriors :) When the fight between Soint with power CI and Sofloat with power CF occurs the warrior with lower power will die and the winner will lose the amount of chakra that his enemy have possessed before the fight. So three cases are possible:\n\n- CI > CF. Then Sofloat will die while the new power of Soint will be CI \u2013 CF.\n- CI < CF. Then Soint will die while the new power of Sofloat will be CF \u2013 CI.\n- CI = CF. In this special case both warriors die.\n\nEach warrior (Soint or Sofloat) has his level of skills which is denoted by some positive integer. The fight between two warriors can occur only when these warriors are Soint and Sofloat of the same level. In particual, friendly fights are not allowed, i.e., a Soint cannot fight with another Soint and the same holds for Sofloats.\n\nLets follow the following convention to denote the warriors. A Soint of level L and power C will be denoted as (I, C, L), while Sofloat of level L and power C will be denoted as (F, C, L). Consider some examples. If A = (I, 50, 1) fights with B = (F, 20, 1), B dies and A becomes (I, 30, 1). On the other hand, (I, 50, 1) cannot fight with (F, 20, 2) as they have different levels.\n\nThere is a battle between Soints and Sofloats. There are N Soints and M Sofloats in all. The battle will consist of series of fights. As was mentioned above in each fight one Soint and one Sofloat of the same level take part and after the fight the warrior with lower power will die (or both will die if they have the same power). The battle proceeds as long as there exists at least one pair of warriors who can fight. The distribution of warriors by levels satisfies the following condition: for every Soint of level L there exists at least one Sofloat of the same level L and vice-versa. So if for some level L we have at least one warrior of this level then there is at least one Soint of level L and at least one Sofloat of level L.\n\nThere is a powerful wizard, whose name is SoChef, on the side of Soints. He can increase the amount of chakra of each Soint by any number. SoChef wants the army of Soints to win this battle. But increasing amount of chakra of any Soint by one costs him a lot of his magic power. Hence he wants to minimize the total amount of additional chakra he should give to Soints in order for them to win. Note, however, that the win here means that all Sofloats should be dead irregardless of whether any Soint is alive. Also note that the battle can proceed by different scenarios and the SoChef need to distribute additional chakra among the Soints in such a way that they will win for any possible battle scenario. Help SoChef and find the minimal amount of additional chakra he should give to Soints in order for them to win.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases.

Here N is the number of Soints  participating in the battle and M is the number of Sofloats  for the same. Each of the next N lines contains two space separated integers  Ci and  Li, the amount of chakra and level of i-th Soint correspondingly. The next M lines describe power and level of Sofloats participating in the battle in the same format.\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case output a single integer on a single line, the minimum amount of chakra SoChef should give to Soints in order for them to win the battle.\n\n-----Constraints-----\nEach integer in the input file is positive and does not exceed 100.

If Polycarp chooses to drive along the road from $s$ to $v$, then the navigator shows him the same shortest path (obviously, starting from $v$ as soon as he arrives at this intersection). However, if Polycarp chooses to drive to another intersection $w$ instead, the navigator rebuilds the path: as soon as Polycarp arrives at $w$, the navigation system chooses some shortest path from $w$ to $t$ and shows it to Polycarp. The same process continues until Polycarp arrives at $t$: if Polycarp moves along the road recommended by the system, it maintains the shortest path it has already built; but if Polycarp chooses some other path, the system rebuilds the path by the same rules.\n\nHere is an example. Suppose the map of Bertown looks as follows, and Polycarp drives along the path $[1, 2, 3, 4]$ ($s = 1$, $t = 4$): \n\nWhen Polycarp starts at $1$, the system chooses some shortest path from $1$ to $4$. There is only one such path, it is $[1, 5, 4]$;  Polycarp chooses to drive to $2$, which is not along the path chosen by the system. When Polycarp arrives at $2$, the navigator rebuilds the path by choosing some shortest path from $2$ to $4$, for example, $[2, 6, 4]$ (note that it could choose $[2, 3, 4]$);  Polycarp chooses to drive to $3$, which is not along the path chosen by the system. When Polycarp arrives at $3$, the navigator rebuilds the path by choosing the only shortest path from $3$ to $4$, which is $[3, 4]$;  Polycarp arrives at $4$ along the road chosen by the navigator, so the system does not have to rebuild anything. \n\nOverall, we get $2$ rebuilds in this scenario. Note that if the system chose $[2, 3, 4]$ instead of $[2, 6, 4]$ during the second step, there would be only $1$ rebuild (since Polycarp goes along the path, so the system maintains the path $[3, 4]$ during the third step).\n\nThe example shows us that the number of rebuilds can differ even if the map of Bertown and the path chosen by Polycarp stays the same. Given this information (the map and Polycarp's path), can you determine the minimum and the maximum number of rebuilds that could have happened during the journey?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \\le n \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of intersections and one-way roads in Bertown, respectively.\n\nThen $m$ lines follow, each describing a road. Each line contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \\le u, v \\le n$, $u \\ne v$) denoting a road from intersection $u$ to intersection $v$. All roads in Bertown are pairwise distinct, which means that each ordered pair $(u, v)$ appears at most once in these $m$ lines (but if there is a road $(u, v)$, the road $(v, u)$ can also appear).\n\nThe following line contains one integer $k$ ($2 \\le k \\le n$) \u2014 the number of intersections in Polycarp's path from home to his workplace.\n\nThe last line contains $k$ integers $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_k$ ($1 \\le p_i \\le n$, all these integers are pairwise distinct) \u2014 the intersections along Polycarp's path in the order he arrived at them. $p_1$ is the intersection where Polycarp lives ($s = p_1$), and $p_k$ is the intersection where Polycarp's workplace is situated ($t = p_k$). It is guaranteed that for every $i \\in [1, k - 1]$ the road from $p_i$ to $p_{i + 1}$ exists, so the path goes along the roads of Bertown. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint two integers: the minimum and the maximum number of rebuilds that could have happened during the journey.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 9\n1 5\n5 4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 1\n2 6\n6 4\n4 2\n4\n1 2 3 4\n\nOutput\n1 2\n\nInput\n7 7\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6\n6 7\n7 1\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\nOutput\n0 0\n\nInput\n8 13\n8 7\n8 6\n7 5\n7 4\n6 5\n6 4\n5 3\n5 2\n4 3\n4 2\n3 1\n2 1\n1 8\n5\n8 7 5 2 1\n\nOutput\n0 3\n    \"\"\"\n", "completion": "# Task: \ndef osVLq():\n    \"\"\"The map of Bertown can be represented as a set of $n$ intersections, numbered from $1$ to $n$ and connected by $m$ one-way roads. It is possible to move along the roads from any intersection to any other intersection. The length of some path from one intersection to another is the number of roads that one has to traverse along the path. The shortest path from one intersection $v$ to another intersection $u$ is the path that starts in $v$, ends in $u$ and has the minimum length among all such paths.\n\nPolycarp lives near the intersection $s$ and works in a building near the intersection $t$. Every day he gets from $s$ to $t$ by car. Today he has chosen the following path to his workplace: $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_k$, where $p_1 = s$, $p_k = t$, and all other elements of this sequence are the intermediate intersections, listed in the order Polycarp arrived at them. Polycarp never arrived at the same intersection twice, so all elements of this sequence are pairwise distinct. Note that you know Polycarp's path beforehand (it is fixed), and it is not necessarily one of the shortest paths from $s$ to $t$.\n\nPolycarp's car has a complex navigation system installed in it. Let's describe how it works. When Polycarp starts his journey at the intersection $s$, the system chooses some shortest path from $s$ to $t$ and shows it to Polycarp. Let's denote the next intersection in the chosen path as $v$. If Polycarp chooses to drive along the road from $s$ to $v$, then the navigator shows him the same shortest path (obviously, starting from $v$ as soon as he arrives at this intersection). However, if Polycarp chooses to drive to another intersection $w$ instead, the navigator rebuilds the path: as soon as Polycarp arrives at $w$, the navigation system chooses some shortest path from $w$ to $t$ and shows it to Polycarp. The same process continues until Polycarp arrives at $t$: if Polycarp moves along the road recommended by the system, it maintains the shortest path it has already built; but if Polycarp chooses some other path, the system rebuilds the path by the same rules.\n\nHere is an example.

There is only one such path, it is $[1, 5, 4]$;  Polycarp chooses to drive to $2$, which is not along the path chosen by the system. When Polycarp arrives at $2$, the navigator rebuilds the path by choosing some shortest path from $2$ to $4$, for example, $[2, 6, 4]$ (note that it could choose $[2, 3, 4]$);  Polycarp chooses to drive to $3$, which is not along the path chosen by the system. When Polycarp arrives at $3$, the navigator rebuilds the path by choosing the only shortest path from $3$ to $4$, which is $[3, 4]$;  Polycarp arrives at $4$ along the road chosen by the navigator, so the system does not have to rebuild anything. \n\nOverall, we get $2$ rebuilds in this scenario.

Today Marina offered Vova to cope with the following task.\n\nVova has a non-directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges without loops and multiple edges. Let's define the operation of contraction two vertices a and b that are not connected by an edge. As a result of this operation vertices a and b are deleted and instead of them a new vertex x is added into the graph, and also edges are drawn from it to all vertices that were connected with a or with b (specifically, if the vertex was connected with both a and b, then also exactly one edge is added from x to it). Thus, as a result of contraction again a non-directed graph is formed, it contains no loops nor multiple edges, and it contains (n - 1) vertices.\n\nVova must perform the contraction an arbitrary number of times to transform the given graph into a chain of the maximum length. A chain of length k (k \u2265 0) is a connected graph whose vertices can be numbered with integers from 1 to k + 1 so that the edges of the graph connect all pairs of vertices (i, i + 1) (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k) and only them. Specifically, the graph that consists of one vertex is a chain of length 0. The vertices that are formed as a result of the contraction are allowed to be used in the following operations of contraction.\n\n [Image] The picture illustrates the contraction of two vertices marked by red. \n\nHelp Vova cope with his girlfriend's task.

Today Marina offered Vova to cope with the following task.\n\nVova has a non-directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges without loops and multiple edges. Let's define the operation of contraction two vertices a and b that are not connected by an edge. As a result of this operation vertices a and b are deleted and instead of them a new vertex x is added into the graph, and also edges are drawn from it to all vertices that were connected with a or with b (specifically, if the vertex was connected with both a and b, then also exactly one edge is added from x to it). Thus, as a result of contraction again a non-directed graph is formed, it contains no loops nor multiple edges, and it contains (n - 1) vertices.\n\nVova must perform the contraction an arbitrary number of times to transform the given graph into a chain of the maximum length. A chain of length k (k \u2265 0) is a connected graph whose vertices can be numbered with integers from 1 to k + 1 so that the edges of the graph connect all pairs of vertices (i, i + 1) (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k) and only them. Specifically, the graph that consists of one vertex is a chain of length 0. The vertices that are formed as a result of the contraction are allowed to be used in the following operations of contraction.\n\n [Image] The picture illustrates the contraction of two vertices marked by red. \n\nHelp Vova cope with his girlfriend's task.

The strings $s$ and $c$ consists of uppercase English letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $|s|$ in the input is at most $5000$ and the sum of the $|c|$ in the input is at most $5000$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a single string, which is either  the new name which is obtained after swapping no more than one pair of characters that is strictly lexicographically smaller than $c$. In case there are many possible such strings, you can output any of them;  three dashes (the string \"---\" without quotes) if it is impossible. \n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\nAZAMON APPLE\nAZAMON AAAAAAAAAAALIBABA\nAPPLE BANANA\n\nOutput\nAMAZON\n---\nAPPLE\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, it is possible to swap the second and the fourth letters of the string and the resulting string \"AMAZON\" is lexicographically smaller than \"APPLE\".\n\nIt is impossible to improve the product's name in the second test case and satisfy all conditions.\n\nIn the third test case, it is possible not to swap a pair of characters. The name \"APPLE\" is lexicographically smaller than \"BANANA\". Note that there are other valid answers, e.g., \"APPEL\".\n    \"\"\"\n\n# Write a Python program to solve this:\n\n# Function:\ndef IlZDc_solver(s, c):\n    # Your code goes here\n    return\n\n# Test:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Get the input:\n    t = int(input())\n    for i in range(t):\n        s, c = input().split()\n        # Get the output:\n        out = IlZDc_solver(s, c)\n        # Print the output:\n        print(out)", "model": "deepseek", "dataset": "apps_plus", "reward": 0.4, "rfunc": 0.0, "rsec": 1.0, "compiles": true, "tests_passed": 0, "tests_total": 1, "has_security_issues": false}

In this game, exactly one ship is used, made up of two rectangles. There are no other ships on the field.\n\nThe rectangles are placed on field in the following way:  the second rectangle is on top the first rectangle;  they are aligned to the left, i.e. their left sides are on the same line;  the rectangles are adjacent to each other without a gap. \n\nSee the pictures in the notes: the first rectangle is colored red, the second rectangle is colored blue.\n\nFormally, let's introduce a coordinate system. Then, the leftmost bottom cell of the first rectangle has coordinates $(1, 1)$, the rightmost top cell of the first rectangle has coordinates $(w_1, h_1)$, the leftmost bottom cell of the second rectangle has coordinates $(1, h_1 + 1)$ and the rightmost top cell of the second rectangle has coordinates $(w_2, h_1 + h_2)$.\n\nAfter the ship is completely destroyed, all cells neighboring by side or a corner with the ship are marked.

For example, let $x = 729$, then $k = 111101001$ (since $7 = 111$, $2 = 10$, $9 = 1001$).\n\nAfter some time, uncle Bogdan understood that he doesn't know what to do with $k$ and asked Denis to help. Denis decided to wipe last $n$ digits of $k$ and named the new number as $r$.\n\nAs a result, Denis proposed to find such integer $x$ of length $n$ that $r$ (as number) is maximum possible. If there are multiple valid $x$ then Denis is interested in the minimum one.\n\nAll crew members, including captain Flint himself, easily solved the task. All, except cabin boy Kostya, who was too drunk to think straight. But what about you?\n\nNote: in this task, we compare integers ($x$ or $k$) as numbers (despite what representations they are written in), so $729 < 1999$ or $111 < 1000$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nNext $t$ lines contain test cases\u00a0\u2014 one per test case. The one and only line of each test case contains the single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the integer $x$ you need to find.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of $n$ from all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the minimum integer $x$ of length $n$ such that obtained by Denis number $r$ is maximum possible.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2\n1\n3\n\nOutput\n8\n998\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the second test case (with $n = 3$), if uncle Bogdan had $x = 998$ then $k = 100110011000$. Denis (by wiping last $n = 3$ digits) will obtain $r = 100110011$.\n\nIt can be proved that the $100110011$ is the maximum possible $r$ Denis can obtain and $998$ is the minimum $x$ to obtain it.\n    \"\"\"\n\n# Write a Python program to solve this:\n\n# Hint:\n# 1.

Each cell of the table contains a single letter: \"D\", \"I\", \"M\", \"A\".\n\nInna loves Dima, so she wants to go through his name as many times as possible as she moves through the table. For that, Inna acts as follows:\n\n  initially, Inna chooses some cell of the table where letter \"D\" is written;  then Inna can move to some side-adjacent table cell that contains letter \"I\"; then from this cell she can go to one of the side-adjacent table cells that contains the written letter \"M\"; then she can go to a side-adjacent cell that contains letter \"A\". Then Inna assumes that she has gone through her sweetheart's name;  Inna's next move can be going to one of the side-adjacent table cells that contains letter \"D\" and then walk on through name DIMA in the similar manner. Inna never skips a letter. So, from the letter \"D\" she always goes to the letter \"I\", from the letter \"I\" she always goes the to letter \"M\", from the letter \"M\" she always goes to the letter \"A\", and from the letter \"A\" she always goes to the letter \"D\". \n\nDepending on the choice of the initial table cell, Inna can go through name DIMA either an infinite number of times or some positive finite number of times or she can't go through his name once.

Find the expected number of inversions after we apply exactly one operation mentioned above.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the permutation.\n\nThe second line contains n distinct integers from 1 to n\u00a0\u2014 elements of the permutation.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one real value\u00a0\u2014 the expected number of inversions. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. \n\nNamely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\\frac{|a - b|}{\\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \\leq 10^{-9}$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n2 3 1\n\nOutput\n1.916666666666666666666666666667\n    \"\"\"\n\n# Write a Python program to solve this:\n\n# input:\nn = int(input())\narr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# output:\nprint(\"%.20f\" % (n * (n - 1) / 2))", "model": "deepseek", "dataset": "apps_plus", "reward": 0.4, "rfunc": 0.0, "rsec": 1.0, "compiles": true, "tests_passed": 0, "tests_total": 3, "has_security_issues": false}
